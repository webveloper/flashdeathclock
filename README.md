# Flash Death Clock


### The clock that does the countdown to the death of the Flash

`2021-01-01 00:00:00.000`

It is [the distant future](https://genius.com/Flight-of-the-conchords-robots-lyrics)  
The year 2021  
(We are web developers)  
The world is quite different  
Ever since the standards uprising  
Of the late twenty-teens  
There is no more unhappiness  
We no longer say yes  
Instead we say affirmative  
Unless we know the other developer really well  
(There are no more NPAPI plugins in the browser)  
Well there's no more Flash player, so...  
(Ah) But still, it's good...


#### The Announcement

*July 25, 2017*

**[Flash & the Future of Interactive Content](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html)**

> Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.
